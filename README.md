This document provides step-by-step instructions to set up, run, and build your Vite React project.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
2. [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) or npm

You can verify these by running:

```bash
node -v
yarn -v   # or npm -v
```

---

## Steps to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual repository URL.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd <project-directory>
```

Replace `<project-directory>` with the name of your project folder.

### 3. Install Dependencies

If you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

If you're using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

If you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

If you're using npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The development server should start, and you can view the application in your browser at:

```bash
http://localhost:5173
```

## Build the Project

To create a production build of your project:

If you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

If you're using npm:

```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready files will be available in the `dist` folder.

---

## Preview the Production Build

To preview the production build locally:

If you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn preview
```

If you're using npm:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will serve the files in the `dist` folder on a local server.

Happy coding!
